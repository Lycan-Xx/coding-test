Artwork/Shapes:

    A stylized brain or thought bubble made of interconnected dots or a simple, flowing line drawing. This visual symbolizes the process of learning and connecting ideas.

    Subtle, faded geometric shapes (circles, triangles) that appear to be floating or intersecting in the background, adding a touch of modern design without being distracting.

Your Notes. Your Tests. Your A's.

You've spent hours reading your notes. Highlighting every line. Re-reading pages until your eyes blur. But when it's time for the test, you still feel lost.

You're not alone.

Most of us study passively—and it's a huge waste of time. StudyWise AI takes a different approach. It turns your notes into personalized practice tests, so you can stop just reading and start truly learning.

Page 2: The Journey (How It Works)

Artwork/Shapes:

    Icons for each step that are simple and consistent in style (e.g., a paper icon for 'Upload', a question mark for 'Create', a checkmark for 'Verify', and a graduation cap for 'Learn').

    Use subtle, flowing lines to connect the steps visually, guiding the user's eye down the page.
