App Concept: "StudyWise AI" - The Intelligent Test Generator

1. Core Concept

StudyWise AI is an intelligent application designed to transform passive study notes into active learning tools. Users upload their notes, and the AI guides them through creating, verifying, and taking customized tests to master material, identify knowledge gaps, and track their performance over time.

2. User Journey & Core Features

The user experience is designed to be a logical and efficient lifecycle from note upload to test completion.

A. Step 1: Note Upload

    Users begin by uploading or pasting their study notes in Text or Markdown format.

B. Step 2: The Test Creation Wizard
Instead of guessing or providing a free-form prompt, the user is immediately guided through a simple, multi-step wizard to define the exact test they need.

    Part 1: Context: The user provides the Subject and key Topics of the notes to give the AI context.

    Part 2: Parameters: The user sets all the specific parameters for their test, including:

        Question Type (e.g., Multiple Choice, True/False).

        The exact Number of Questions they want.

        An optional Time Limit.

C. Step 3: AI Generation & Automated Accuracy Check
Once the wizard is complete, the system takes over in the background.

    A single, highly-optimized prompt is constructed based on the user's input.

    The AI generates the exact number of questions requested.

    The Multi-Layered Accuracy System runs automatically:

        Strict Instructions: The AI is forced to base questions only on the provided notes and to cite the source sentence for each answer.

        AI Double-Check: A secondary, low-cost process verifies that the AI's answer is factually supported by the notes, discarding any failed questions.

D. Step 4: The Preview & Decision Page
The user is presented with a preview of their fully-formed test.

    They can review each question alongside its "proof sentence" from their notes, allowing for a quick and confident quality check.

    From this page, they have two clear choices:

        Start Test: To begin the test immediately.

        Save to Library: To save the fully configured test for a later study session.

E. Step 5: Taking the Test & Receiving Results

    If the user starts the test, they proceed to the testing interface.

    Upon completion, they receive an immediate score and a detailed results page.

    Source Linking: On the results page, each question features a reference link that takes the user directly to the source of the answer in their original notes, making revision seamless.

3. The Library: Your Personal Study Hub

The Library is where saved tests are stored, making StudyWise AI a persistent study companion.

    Free users are limited to three saved tests in their library.

    Each saved item contains the original note, the test parameters, and the AI-generated questions.

    From the library, a user can:

        Start a previously saved test at any time.

        Reconfigure a test, which pre-loads the original notes into the wizard to generate a new test with different parameters.

        Delete a test to free up space.

4. Monetization & Future Roadmap

A. Freemium Model

    Free Tier: All core features, limited to Text/Markdown uploads, a character limit, and three saved tests.

    Premium Tier (Future): Unlocks advanced features, including:

        Support for Word (.docx) and PDF formats.

        An increased or unlimited number of saved tests.

        Higher character limits.

        An advanced difficulty level setting.

B. Future Features

    Save, Export, and Share: A feature to save tests as documents or share them with study partners via a link (which will require the recipient to sign up or log in).

    User Feedback Mechanism: A dialogue on the results page for users to provide feedback on question quality, helping to refine the AI over time.

5. Foundational Pillars

    Data Privacy: A clear and transparent privacy policy is mandatory, ensuring users that their notes are kept confidential and secure.

    Backend Efficiency: The wizard-based approach ensures that all AI-related costs are predictable and efficient, forming the foundation of a sustainable business model.
